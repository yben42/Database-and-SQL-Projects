## Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling

Designed an Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram for a large-scale fitness program commissioned by Liverpool City Council. The model includes:

- Entity definitions for participants, trainers, sessions, exercises, equipment, and locations  
- Specialization for multi-type equipment (e.g., weights, running machines, swimming pools)  
- Binary relationships with cardinality constraints  
- Participation tracking and session eligibility rules  
- Representation of user-specific equipment restrictions for safety and personalization

The design emphasizes normalization, extensibility, and compliance with conceptual modeling best practices.

## Relational Algebra

Applied formal relational algebra expressions to query a simplified fitness center schema. Query objectives included:

- Identifying instructors based on class cost  
- Filtering participants by enrollment history  
- Division-style logic for complete class participation  
- Detecting non-unique attribute values (e.g., duplicate names)

Queries were written to emphasize correctness, minimal redundancy, and adherence to core relational operations introduced in the course.
